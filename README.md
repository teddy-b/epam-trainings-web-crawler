# Web Crawler

Simple web crawler that starts from a choosen song in ***YouTube***, selects the up-next song and visits the new link until it gathers a playlist of 10 songs.


* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `node crawler.js` to start the application.
* Open [http://localhost:8080/scrape](http://localhost:8080/scrape) in the browser to receive the playlist as ***html***.
* Check the file directory for the `playlist.json` file.
